# Data Analysis on OTT Platforms
## Description
In this new era of online platforms, there have been many movie content platforms people use to make their busy life
relaxed by watching movies online according to their convenience. But because there exists large datasets of movies it becomes
very difficult for the user to search and select a movie. In this study, we have discussed movie recommender systems and its techniques.
## The idea
We have tried to analyze the in-depth problem of why some movies get more fame and what all the factors responsible for a movie or a
web-series to gainer recognition by performing Exploratory data analysis and visualizing the pre-processed using Tableau tool
which is widely used in this domain. Visualizations depict significant relations and the sentiment of the users behind every movie
as well as the parameters being considered and evaluated will eventually be a prominent key for any individual who is involved
in this field. Factors mainly the geographic location, genre of the film, recognition of actor and director, the past history of the
films directed by that director and many more are to be paid much attention while working in this and which we have very well
demonstrated here.

## Long description
In the modern world there is a need for a recommendation system as users have been exposed to a large number of multimedia
contents with the rise of OTT platforms such as Netflix, Disney Plus and many more. Many recommendation systems are available
along with a large number of algorithms that are used for data forecasting for specific results that the user needs. Collaborative
approach is divided into 2 methods i.e Model-based and Memory-based. Neural network generation happens in model based
methods which understands the facts and shows the required results/recommendation. The well-known recommendation strategy
of commercial OTT services is to use userâ€™s rating data, which is then fed for collaborative filtering.
Movie recommendation systems are very popular. They will gain more popularity in the coming years as the filmmaking industry
is getting vast and there will be numerous options for the user to choose from the huge collection. So in this vast collection,
users only wish to watch a certain language, theme, genres or some different constraints. In this situation the recommendation
system works. It uses the concept of machine learning and works on it by learning the datasets. After that the recommendations can
be based on search history, language, same genre, etc. This technique is used to meet the customer needs and getting benefitted by
delivering the contents according to the user.
We have studied and analyzed 3 major OTT platforms i.e. Amazon Prime, Netflix and Disney Plus. We studied IMDB movie
dataset along with the datasets of each platform to analyze the distribution of various constraints like movie genre, age limits, etc
to get the tags representing each platform.
To investigate different OTT platform datasets, analyze the utilization of platforms to provide users with accurate movie
recommendations. To personalize a platform for the user the system will search content that the user is interested in and will
accordingly show the results. Now the simplest way possible is by recommending the top trending content to the user but to make
it more personalized for the user, dedicated recommendation systems are needed.
